## UI Design Wireframe
| Choices | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Colour Palette | The colour theme I chose was white, pastel green and other variations. The white gives a clean and semi-professional look. While on the other hand, the pastel green also gives gives the website welcoming look. The various shades of green can be used to highlight certain aspects of the UI such as button, textboxes, etc. |
| Typography | I chose a combination of the fonts Newsreader and Inter. They are both clear and professional fonts perfect for my goal of trying to create a casual professional website. |
| Images | The images I chose for the recipes and products are all eye-catching, straight to the point, and appealing. These images will allow the user to see recipes and products before they make or buy them. |

### Feedback Incorporated
Following my client's feedback I reduced the amount of text on the pages by making the descriptions shorter and the instructions more concise. The recipes also have more images to break up the text more. Additionally, I resized the product displays, which were previously unnecessarily large. Furthermore, I reduced the scrolling required on all pages, as per the client's request, especially on the homepage and increased image sizes for better user engagement.
